# Hackathon Context: Stellar x Polkadot HackerHouse BLR

## Event Details
- **Event:** Stellar x Polkadot HackerHouse BLR
- **Dates:** December 4-6, 2024
- **Location:** The Hosteller, Indiranagar, Bangalore
- **Current Time:** 2 AM, December 5th, 2024
- **Submission Deadline:** 6:30-8:30 AM, December 6th, 2024
- **Time Available:** ~28 hours

## Core Requirement
**CRITICAL:** Projects MUST meaningfully leverage BOTH Stellar AND Polkadot ecosystems together.

This is NOT about supporting multiple chains independently - it's about cross-ecosystem integration where both chains play essential roles.

## Judging Criteria (Priority Order)

### 1. Cross-Ecosystem Integration (HIGHEST WEIGHT)
- How well does the project bridge Stellar and Polkadot?
- Are both chains essential to the solution?
- Does it demonstrate meaningful interoperability?

### 2. Feasibility
- Does it actually work?
- Is there a working demo?
- Can it be deployed in production?

### 3. Usability
- Would real people use this?
- Is the UX intuitive?
- Does it solve a real problem?

### 4. Implementation Quality
- Is the code clean and well-structured?
- Are there proper error handling and edge cases?
- Is it production-ready?

### 5. Innovation
- Is this solving a new problem?
- Is the approach novel?
- Does it create new possibilities?

### 6. Pitching
- Can you explain it clearly in 5 minutes?
- Is the value proposition obvious?
- Does the demo showcase the key features?

## Submission Requirements

### 1. GitHub Repository
- Clean commit history showing work during December 4-6
- Meaningful commit messages with timestamps
- All code must be verifiable as new development

### 2. Demo Video (3-5 minutes)
- Public link (YouTube/X/Vimeo)
- Show the project actually working
- Explain the problem being solved
- Highlight cross-ecosystem integration
- **CRITICAL:** This is often more important than the code itself

### 3. Project Description (max 500 words)
- What problem does it solve?
- How do Stellar and Polkadot work together?
- What's your technical approach?

### 4. Team Contact
- At least one member available for final judging rounds

## Ecosystem Details

### Stellar
- **Strengths:** 3-5 second finality, sub-cent transaction fees, native asset tokenization
- **Smart Contracts:** Soroban (Rust-based)
- **Best For:** Payments, fast transactions, asset issuance, liquidity pools
- **Testnet:** Stellar Testnet (Futurenet for Soroban)
- **APIs:** Horizon API for blockchain data

### Polkadot
- **Strengths:** Shared security, parallel processing, cross-chain messaging (XCM)
- **Smart Contracts:** Ink! (Rust-based), Substrate parachains
- **Best For:** Complex logic, governance, staking, cross-chain communication
- **Testnet:** Rococo, Westend
- **APIs:** Polkadot.js, Subscan API

## What Judges Want to See

### ✅ DO THIS
- Solve a real, specific problem
- Make both chains essential (not interchangeable)
- Have a working demo (even if simple)
- Clear, compelling pitch
- Clean commit history during event
- Show cross-chain interaction clearly

### ❌ AVOID THIS
- Supporting multiple chains independently (that's not cross-chain)
- Complex features that don't work
- Unclear value proposition
- Broken demos
- Trying to hide pre-existing code
- Overcomplicating the solution

## Available Resources

### Mentorship
- Direct access to Stellar India team
- Edgetributors/ArQ (MontaQ Labs) for Polkadot
- On-demand mentoring throughout event
- **USE THEM HEAVILY** - they want you to succeed

### Workshops
- December 5th: 10:30 AM - 1 PM
- Stellar x Polkadot mini-workshops
- Technical deep-dives
- **ATTEND AND TAKE NOTES**

### Mandatory Mentoring Round
- December 5th: 2:30 - 5:30 PM
- Get feedback on your project
- Course-correct if needed

## Success Strategy

### Time Management
- **Don't overcomplicate** - simple working demo beats complex broken project
- **Parallelize work** - divide team effectively
- **Leave time for demo video** - this is critical
- **Practice your pitch** - 5 minutes to win

### Technical Approach
- Use existing APIs and SDKs (Horizon, Polkadot.js)
- Don't build everything from scratch
- Focus on the cross-chain integration
- Make sure the demo is visual and impressive

### Presentation
- Lead with the problem
- Show both chains working together
- Make the value proposition crystal clear
- Have a compelling use case

## Prize Pool
- **1st Place:** ₹15,000
- **2nd Place:** ₹10,000
- **3rd Place:** ₹5,000
- **Participation:** ₹20,000 split among valid submissions

**Note:** Every valid submission that meets requirements gets something.

## Key Takeaway
**This hackathon is about CROSS-ECOSYSTEM INNOVATION, not multi-chain support.**

Your project should answer: "Why do I need BOTH Stellar AND Polkadot for this solution?"

If you can build it on just one chain, you're missing the point.
